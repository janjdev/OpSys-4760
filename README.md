# Cmp Sci 4760 – Operating Systems
This is a course about operating systems and system programming.
Learning will comprise of the algorithms to manage the internals of operating systems, specifically interprocess communications, process scheduling, resource
management, memory management, file systems, and I/O scheduling. All programming in Linux using the Gnu C compiler.

## Course Description 
This course covers the structure of a generic operating system, considering in detail the algorithms
for interprocess communications, process scheduling, resource management, memory management, file
systems, and device management. It presents examples from contemporary operating systems. This course also
requires practical projects implemented within a modern operating system or simulator environment.

### Texts
- Stallings. Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ. 2017. Required.
- Robbins/Robbins. Unix Systems Programming – Communication, Concurrency, and Threads. Prentice-Hall, 2003. Required.
- Bic. Operating Systems. zyBooks, 2021. Optional.

## Goals of the course 
This course will deepen your understanding of system programming, building on the foundation
acquired in CMP SCI 2750. You will use your programming skills to design and implement data structures and
algorithms used in the innards of an operating system. The overall goals of the course are:
- Understand the internals of a generic operating system
- Improve your programming skills by working on non-trivial simulations
- Become an expert programmer, ready to tackle industrial strength projects

## Topics 
We’ll discuss the structure of a generic operating system, with an emphasis on the algorithms and data
structures needed to perform various tasks to manage processes, resources, memory, files, and IO devices. We’ll
touch on the security aspects of the operating systems throughout the course. There will be extensive programming
in C under Linux environment. The sequence of topics will be as follows (in that order):
- Function, Types, and Structure of Operating Systems.
- Concurrent Programming, Process Interaction and Synchronization.
- Process Management and Scheduling.
- Resource Management and Deadlock Problem.
- Memory Management.
- File System and I/O management.

## Outcomes 
At the end of this course, you are expected to be able to proficiently perform system programming
tasks. You should also be able to explain different operating systems topics outlined above. You should know the
algorithms to achieve various tasks in operating systems and use the knowledge to improve the performance of your
programs
